## Tair:Config Server
Tair is a distributed data storage system used by TaoBao (E-Commerse Platform under Alibaba).  
This article mainly forcus on config server related knowledge in this system, including the keeping of hash table, which is used to realize loading balance.

### Architecture of Tair

Tair consists three kinds of components: client, config server and data server.  
**Data server** is used to keep data. The data is in key-value form. Data server also has pulgins, which can be designed by users and react to requests and responses. Storage engine is a vitual interface to file system. Users can implement the storage engine to any file system they like.  
**Config server** will keep a hash table. The hash table will decide which data sever a key-value pair should be stored.  
There is an example:  

Bucket Number|Master Server|Slave Server
------|-------|------
0|A|B
1|B|C
2|C|A
3|A|B
4|B|C
5|C|A
  
Suppose a data <7,"LIKE"> is coming. Since 7 mod 6 = 1, the data should be stored in both B server and C server, with B server being the master and C server keep the backup data of <7,"LIKE">.  
Config server will use heartbeet checking to know the status of data servers, and update hash table ontime. Also, there are two config servers: one is the master server and the other one is slave server as the backup of master.
**Client** will first communicate with config server to get the hash table, so then it will know which data server it should communicate with.

### Architecture of Config Server
![](/pic/KN02-2.png)  
**tair\_cfb\_server** is the entranse of config server. A new thread, **server\_conf\_thread** will be created and TCP ports will be listened. The load\_config\_server() in **server\_conf\_thread** will decide the role, master of slave (the first server in the list will be master and the second one will be slave).  
**group\_info** is keeping the data of a group. We can regard a group as a database, since it has its own hash table and server list. A config server can manage multiple groups at the same time so there is a list in **server\_conf\_thread** to keep all **group\_info**. Each **group\_info** has its own **config\_server\_table\_manager** to manage the related data of its hash table. **config\_server\_table\_manager** provides all kinds of methods to get and modify these data. However, the building process of hash table is realized by **table\_builder**. **table\_builder1** and **table\_builder2** are different inplementations of **table\_builder** according to different strategy.  
Also, each server has its own information, which is keeped by **server\_info**.

### The process of config server backup

Firstly, during the start process of a config server, it will load config file and comfirm its own role.

Then, the thread of the config server will enter run(). Before entering loops, the config server will load group files and build group and server lists first. Then it will check the status of all data servers and the other config servers in the loop.

The change of master config server will be done in check\_config\_server\_status().

### The process of data server management

Then each **group\_info** in the rebuild list will call **table\_builder** to rebuild the hash table.

When a data server is alive again, it will also trigger the need of rebuild hash table.

### Hash Table
#### Structure & Rule
![](/pic/KN02-8.png)  
The data structure of hash table is a map, from int to vector. Int means which copy it represent. If copy number equals 1, it means the server is keeping the master copy of the data.  
There are tow strategies used to build the table, and each strategy is implemented by two functions: calculate\_capable() and is\_this\_node\_OK().  
The strategies are implemented to realize five rules:  
>There cannot be too many master tokens (a copy of data) on the server.  
There cannot be too many tokens on the server.  
The number of servers which keep more tokens cannot be too large.  
Two copies of same data cannot be kept on the same server.  
Each room should have at least one copy of all data.  

Different strategy, under different level, satisfy different rules:  
Loading Balance Strategy

Server Type|ALL|POS|BASE|FORCE
-----------|---|----|----|-----
Master|1,4|1,4|1|1,4
Slave|2,4|3,4|3,4|4

Position First Strategy (not just considering spread data into all servers, but also considering spread data into two rooms)  

Server Type|ALL|POS|BASE|FORCE
-----------|---|----|----|-----
Master|1,4,5|1,4,5|1,5|1,4,5
Slave|2,4,5|3,4,5|3,4,5|4,5

#### Process
The process of building a hash table mainly has two parts. I'll use an example to illustrate.  
**calculate\_capable()**:  
Suppose, oringinally, we have 5 data servers to keep 14 tokens (7 pieces of data and each has another one copy: 14 = 7 \* 2). So we get 4 servers to keep 3 tokens and 1 server to keep 2 tokens ( 4\*3 + 1\*2 = 14). Then, a data server goes down, so we only have 4 servers now.  
Therefore, the first step, **calculate\_capable()**, is used to calculate how many tokens each server should keep in the new circumstance. Easily, we can know, now we should have 2 servers to keep 4 tokens and 2 servers to keep 3 tokens. Then, we will decide the number of each server.

The general idea of this process, is to **_make the times of data transmission small_**. If we make servers who used to keep fewer tokens still keep fewer tokens in new circumstance, make servers who used to keep more tokens still keep more tokens in new circumstance, then the times of data transmission should be low.  
The only difference between the two strategies here is that, in position first strategy, we first divide the number into two rooms, then do the calculation in each room separately. Eg. We devide 7 tokens into room 1 and 7 tokens into room2. We have to make sure that each room has at least one copy of all data.  
**is\_this\_node\_OK()**:
Next, we will use the number (how many tokens each server should keep) we calculate to test each server whether they satisfy the rules we mentioned above, which is the process of **is\_this\_node\_OK()**. If we find a server who cannot keep the master token now (maybe it keeps too many master token), we will find a server who keeps the copy of the data to be the master. If we cannot find such slave server, or if a slave server cannot keep the token of this data, we have to find other servers which haven't kept this data to keep the token.  
After the two process, the hash table will be built.
