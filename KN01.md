## Consistency Protocol
Some protocols used to keep data consistency in distributed system.

### CAP Theory
C: Consistency of data. The data in different devices which are in the same distributed system should be the same.  
A: Avaliable. When you want to access the data, you can access the data.  
P: Partition-tolerance. Even though, due to network problems, data may be different in some devices, but the system can still provide correct service to users.

### 2PC Protocol
Two-Phase commit protocal. We choose one server as a coordinator and let it control the process of request in whole system.

Phase-1:  
><font color=#FF00FF>Client send request to coordinator.</font>  
<font>Coordinator will send request to all participant servers.</font>  
<font color=#FF8C00>Participant will process the request locally, and record Undo/Redo logs in log files.</font>  
<font color=#DC143C>After processing the request, participants will send the results of processing to coordinator. If the request is processed successfully, the result will be 'YES'; otherwise, the result will be 'NO'.</font>  

Phase-2:
><font color=#7FFF00>If all the results coordinator recieved are 'YES', the coordinator will announce all participants to commit the request; otherwise, the coordinator will announce all participants to abort the request.</font>  
<font color=#00008B>Participants will commit the request. Or, if recieved abort announciation from coordinator, participants will roll back by logs.</font>  

### Paxos
![](/pic/KN01-2.png)
Proposer: Servers that make a proposal about a value.  
Acceptor: Servers that vote for a proposal.  
Learner: Servers that get a value which has reached a consensus among servers.  
The logic of Paxos:  
>The aim of Paxos protocol is to **_get consensus on one value_**.  
To achieve the aim, the first rule is **_only value accepted by more than half of the servers can reach a consensus_**. The second rule is **_once a value has reached a consensus, anothor different value cannot reach a consensus_**.  
To keep the first rule, Paxos first require **_all Acceptor must accept the first proposal they recieved_**. Then, **_Learner can only learn the value that has been accepted by more than half of the servers_**.  
If we what to keep the second rule, we has to make sure that **_once a proposal has been accepted by more than half of the servers, the proposals proposed later should contain the same value_**.

Process of Paxos:  
>First, proposer will ask acceptors whether N will be a acceptable number for a new proposal.  
Second, a acceptor will check, if N is larger than T-N0 (the largest number of proposal it has accepted) and M (the acceptor promise not to accept proposal with number smaller than M). If N is larger than both, it is acceptable and the acceptor will send T (the latest proposal it has accepted) back to the proposer and change M to N.  
Then, the proposer will find the T with the largest number from all messages sending back from acceptors. The proposer will create a new proposal <N,T-V>: using N as the number of the proposal and the value of T as the value of the new proposal.  
Finally, the proposer will send the new proposal to all acceptors asking them to accept it.

Key of Paxos:  
Every two sets that contain more than half of the servers must have same servers in both of them.
